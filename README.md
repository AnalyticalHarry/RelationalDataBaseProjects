SQLite3 is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It is written in C and provides an API for accessing the database. SQLite3 is often used for embedded systems, IoT devices, and mobile devices, as well as for local storage and caching in web browsers. The database is file-based, so you can use it to store data on disk, and it supports a subset of the SQL standard, including the ability to create tables, insert data, query data, update data, and delete data.
